## 2015.2.5

I see that data-src is a method of defering image loading on multiple sites. baidu.com and washingtonpost.com both use this method.

I also noticed that Firefox 35 on OS X now supports HTML5/mp4 video (not just webm). And many video sites now seem to work with HTML5/mp4. So it looks like this will be a good approach.
